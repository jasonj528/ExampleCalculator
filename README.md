# ExampleCalculator

A basic calculator with no extra functionality over the default Android one.

My intention here is just to ease my way into Android with a simple single-screen application before I try something a bit more advanced.

No this is not an example out of a textbook. I know I can't back that up easily except for the fact that the book I've most recently looked at didn't have anything on ConstraintLayout as I believe that's somewhat new. I'm also not sure if a textbook would have you use shunting yard to parse the text display but who knows.
